# ELE2024-lab-1

## About This Lab
This is a lab for module ELE2024 - Circuits and Control. It uses Python to code the system dynamics of a car, including the use of a PID controller.

## My Submission
My submission contains a Python source file for each of questions 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4.
This means that there is duplicated code between some of these source files in order to allow each question to have its solution contained entirely within one source file.
