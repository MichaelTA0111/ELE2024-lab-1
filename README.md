# ELE2024-lab-1

## About This Lab
This is a lab for module ELE2024 - Circuits and Control. It uses Python to code the system dynamics of a car, including the use of a PID controller.

## My Submission
My submission contains a Python source file for each of questions 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and 3.
There are also source files for each class which was created for this program: car, P controller, PD controller, and PID controller.
Every graph is saved as a .svg file to store vector graphics. All graphs are stored inside the "figures" folder.
